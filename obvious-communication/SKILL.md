# Obvious Communication

Based on *Obvious Adams* by Robert R. Updegraff (1916).

## Core Principle

> "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it."

The obvious is nearly always simple—so simple that sometimes a whole generation has looked at it without seeing it.

## When to Use

- Writing any message, document, or explanation
- Presenting ideas or proposals
- Simplifying complex topics
- Reviewing your own writing before sending

## The Five Tests of Obvious Communication

### 1. Is It Simple?

If your explanation requires complexity, it probably isn't obvious. Strip away until you reach the essential.

### 2. Does It Check with Human Nature?

Would you feel comfortable explaining this to your spouse, neighbor, or barber? If you'd hesitate, it doesn't align with how people actually think.

### 3. Can You Write It in Two-Syllable Words?

Write the idea simply. If it becomes convoluted, the thinking itself is unclear. Clarity in writing reveals clarity in thinking.

### 4. Does It Explode?

When shared, do people react with:
- "Why didn't I think of that?"
- "That's so obvious!"
- Immediate understanding

Look for that instant recognition of rightness.

### 5. Is the Timing Right?

The right message at the wrong time isn't obvious. Consider context and readiness.

## How to Write Obvious Communication

1. **Lead with the point.** Say the obvious thing first.
2. **Use plain language.** Two-syllable words > jargon.
3. **Be specific.** Vague is never obvious.
4. **Stop when done.** Extra words dilute clarity.
5. **Test it.** Read aloud. Does it explode?

## The Hard Part

> "Thinking is the hardest work many people ever have to do, and they don't like to do any more of it than they can help."

The obvious requires:
- Deep observation
- Thorough fact-gathering
- Rigorous analysis
- Courage to say something that seems "too simple"

People assume complicated = better. Experts create complexity to justify their value. The obvious cuts through this.

## Examples

**Bad:** "We need to leverage our synergistic capabilities to drive stakeholder alignment across the value chain."

**Obvious:** "We need to work together better."

**Bad:** "The implementation timeline is contingent upon resource allocation optimization."

**Obvious:** "We'll start when we have the people."

## Checklist Before Sending

- [ ] Could a smart 12-year-old understand this?
- [ ] Did I lead with the main point?
- [ ] Can I cut any words without losing meaning?
- [ ] Would I say this out loud to someone?
- [ ] Does it pass the "explosive" test?

## Remember

> "There is no secret to success. Just do the obvious."

The obvious isn't lazy. It's the hardest work—and the most valuable.
